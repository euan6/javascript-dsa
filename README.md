In this repository I will be creating several different data structures & algorithms using JavaScript.
These will be entirely experimental and just for practice to give myself a challenge.

The first programming concept I have implemented is recursion. I had made a series of small, common problems which can be easily solved using recursion, such as the fibonacci sequence, calculating factorials and summing up an array.
