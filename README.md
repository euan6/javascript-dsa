# javascript-dsa

In this repository I will be creating several different data structures & algorithms using JavaScript. These will be entirely experimental and just for practice to give myself a challenge.

## Recursion

The first programming concept I have implemented is recursion. I had made a series of small, common problems which can be easily solved using recursion, such as the fibonacci sequence, calculating factorials and summing up an array.

## Stack

The first data structure which I have implemented is a stack. A stack is a very simple LIFO structure, meaning the first element pushed to a stack is the last element popped from it. I have given the stack several functions such as isEmpty(), size(), push(e), pop() and top().
